Our final best model is composed by 3 SVMs (since we have a 3-dim output). Each SVM uses a rbf kernel, epsilon=0.05, C=2800.
These hyperparameters were chosed performing a double grid search (first coarse and then more refined) and evaluating the models based
on the best MEE achieved on a 3-fold cross validation on the internal training set.
After model selection, we retrained the model on all the training data and evaluated its performances on the internal test set, obtaining MEE = 0.5097.
Before using our model on the blind test set, we did a final retraining on all the data, including the internal test set.
